### Symfony DDD ( Experimental Project)


This is my Experimental project, it's project is focus on how to build project using Domain Driven Design, combining with Layered Software (Hexagonal), I'm not really familiar with Domain Driven Design, So this is my learning progress project to understanding about domain driven design

### Resouces
DDD is hard, it needs you to change your paradigm, especially if you MVC oriented, I'll try to include Resources that containing all material about DDD and friends. you can access it [here](RESOURCES.md)

### Study Case
to makes this project real, I'll use study case, it's about Course Management System you can become instructors, scheduling, student, etc . we will start from simplest case, then we will go to a bigger domain

### Learning Step
#### Coding rules
  - using TDD first (you can use PHPUnit or phpspec or both, but right now I just focused on class modeling with phpspec to driven the specification)

  - separated your domain code form any framework, this will make your domain code easier to integrated and reusable
