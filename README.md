### Symfony DDD ( Experimtal Project)


This is my Experimental project, it's project is focus on how to build project using Domain Driven Design, combining with Layered Software (Hexagonal), I'm not really familiar with Domain Driven Design, So this is my learning progress project to understanding about domain driven design 

### Resouces
DDD is hard, it's need you to  change your paradigm, especially if you MVC oriented, I'll try to include Resources that containing all material about DDD and friends. you can access it [here](RESOURCES.md)

### Learning Step
#### Coding rules
  - using TDD first (you can use phpunit or phpspec or both, but right now I just focused on class modelling with phpspec to driven the spesification)

  - separated your domain code form any framework, this will makes your domain code easier to integrated and reusable
